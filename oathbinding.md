# Obedience
_7th-level Enchantment_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a golden circlet worth at least 1000 gp)   
**Duration:** Special

The creature you touched must succeed a Wisdom saving throw, or a  circlet of gold magically placed on its head. Once the spell takes effect, you can utter a few mystical words as a bonus action to cause wracking pains in the affected creature. These pains are so intense that the creature cannot do anything, barely able to breathe or talk. Until the start of your next turn, the creature is paralyzed even if the creature is immune to paralyzed. When the pain is maintained, the creature also suffers 1d10 psychic damage at the end of its turn, but no more than once per day.  
Each day the creature is under the spell it is allowed to make a new Wisdom saving throw with a -4 penalty. On success, the spell effect ends. The circlet can only be removed by you or via a [Dispel Magic] spell.  When the target transfers to a new body, for example, via [Clone] or [True Resurrection], the circlet will magically disappear from the old body and reappear on the new body. When the target polymorphs to another form, the circlet melds to the new form but the spell effect does not end.  
You cannot cast this spell on noncorporeal,  undead, or creature without head. However, once the spell takes effect, polymorphing to kinds mentioned above does not suspend or end the effect.
