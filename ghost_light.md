# Ghost Light
_1st-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute   
**Range:** 120 feet   
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of phosphorus)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

This spell summons a ghostly green radiance anywhere within the range of the spell. The light can be used to illuminate some object or can be shaped in any form within the limits of the area of effect. You can control the movement of the light. The ghost light could be formed in the shape of a man and then commanded to walk or fly, for example.  
The light lasts for the duration. Common superstition holds that various evil spirits radiate a light similar to that produced by this spell. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher and a CR or level of 1 or lower must make a Charisma saving throw upon seeing the ghost light. Failed creatures are frightened and run away from the light by the safest available route on each of its turns. If there is nowhere to move, they cower and attempt to hide. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to the light, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the creature cannot be frightened by this spell in 24 hours.
