_9th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes    
**Range:** Self   
**Components:** V, S, M (a pint of your blood and a gem worth at least 5000 gp., both of which are consumed in the casting of this spell)
**Duration:** 10 days

This spell will cause, under certain specific conditions, your body, mind, and spirit to travel to
another location. The transfer is automatic and transfers only the body and those items physically attached to it, but leaving behind any attached items weighing more than 50 lbs. individually. The spell brings together body, spirit, and mind, even if in different locations. When casting this spell, you must detail six specific conditions that the evasion will function under. When any of these situations occurs in the duration, your form is whisked away to the location. This location can be on the same plane or on any other known plane of existence or demiplane that you have visited. Also when casting the spell, you casts two other spells as part of casting  Elminster's Evasion, expending spell slots and consumes material as normal, that will take effect once you arrives at the location.
