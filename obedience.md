**Duration:** Special

This spell binds the target to certain vows and conditions, and stipulates a penalty for failing to meet them. Although similar to a genie contract, this spell binds only one party, not two. This is often offered by a stronger party in return for a favor or as an alternative to some more severe punishment. Such a binding must have a definite end or condition under
which it is broken. A [Dispel Magic] or [Remove Curse] will not counter it. This spell cannot compel extreme changes in behavior or bind the target to lengthy servitude. Since the spell is
voluntary, magic resistance is not a factor.
