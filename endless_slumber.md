_8st-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch   
**Components:** V, S, M (one entire, perfect, blue lotus flower and a pure chunk of amber)    
**Duration:** Special

This spell places a creature in a permanent, unbreakable sleep. While sleeping, the creature remains in a state of suspended animation, requiring no air, food or water. The creature does not age, but they always dream. Even creatures normally resistant or immune to sleep effects are affected by this spell.  
This spell must be cast either directly on the creature by touch, or else be cast on an object that delivers the spell to its target.  
If casted via touching an unwilling, mobile subject, the caster must make a successful melee spell attack, otherwise the spell is lost.  
If the spell is casted on an object, the target must eat the object (such as a fruit), be wounded
by it (a dagger or arrow), or wear it (as a medal lion or ring). Each method of delivering the
spell has its own limitations. If cast on food, the spell dissipates if the object is not eaten within
one day of the casting. If cast on a weapon, the spell is lost if its first attack fails to hit. If cast on a decorative object, this spell ends when the token is removed from the sleeper.  
[Dispel Magic] does not end the effect of this spell, though a [Wish] spell can cancel it. Otherwise, the only means of waking the target is a single strict condition chosen by the caster upon casting this spell. The most famous conditions include the sleeper's return to the place of its birth, a solar eclipse, the death of an immortal dragon, the kiss of a prince or princess, or even the fall of a great empire.
