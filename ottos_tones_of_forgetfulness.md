When you cast this spell, the ears of a creature are filled with exotic tones no one else can hear. The target must make a  Wisdom saving throw. On failure, the target loses one nonweapon proficiency specified by you for the duration. If you does not specify the proficiency upon casting, the target instead loses one nonweapon proficiency chosen randomly. On success, the target still suffers a -2 penalty to the proficiency for the duration. If the penalty reduces the proficiency bonus to or below zero, then the target loses that proficiency for the duration.
