# Ghost Pipes
_2nd-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute   
**Range:** Touch   
**Components:** V, S   
**Duration:** Until touched by a living creature

You touch a nonmagical musical instrument to play itself. The instrument must be whole and
in playing condition. It need not be an instrument that you are proficient, but you must be able to softly whistle or hum the desired tune. This tune can be no more than one minute long.  
Upon releasing the instrument, it glows as if limned with [Faerie Fire] and levitates at the height it was released. The various parts of the instrument (keys, valves, strings, etc.) move under the control of the magic. Upon reaching the end of the tune, the instrument repeats the tune over and over until stopped.  
The ghost pipes stop playing when any living creature touch the instrument. The radiance fades and the instrument slowly settles to the ground.
