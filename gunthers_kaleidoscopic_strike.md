# Gunther's Kaleidoscopic Strike
_8th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S   
**Duration:** Instantaneous

When this spell is cast, a thin beam of shimmering, kaleidoscopic light shoots from your fingertips toward a target spellcaster. The spellcaster must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target wastes spell slots equal to your wizard level minus d20. Any result of zero or a negative number indicates that the target wastes no spell slots.  Spell slots are wasted beginning from 1st level slots and walking up to higher level slots.  
This spell only affects spellcasters with spell slots.
