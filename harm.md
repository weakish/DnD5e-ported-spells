# Harm
_7th-level Necromancy_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S   
**Duration:** Instantaneous

The harm spell corrupts the victim's life energies, causing the loss of all but 1d4 hit points. Noncorporeal, nonliving, and extraplanar creatures arc not affected by the spell. A successful melee spell attack is required, and you have a +4 bonus to the attack roll. The damage must be healed naturally or cured with magic.  
Casting harm is an evil act.
