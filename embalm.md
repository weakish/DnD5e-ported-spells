# Embalm
_2nd-level Necromancy_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch   
**Components:** V, S, M (a salve of rare unguents worth at least 100 gp)    
**Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch a corpse or a part thereof and protect the target from decay.  
If the embalmed cadaver is later animated as a zombie or other form of animated undead, the creature gains +2 hit points per Hit Die (8 hp per Hit Die maximum) because of the greater strength and resiliency imparted by the spell to the dead tissue. The spell has no beneficial effect if cast on skeletal remains or on previously animated undead.  
Thus preserved, a corpse permanently retains the same odor and appearance it had at the time of casting. The embalm spell does not reverse the effects of putrefaction, but it does prevent any further decay of an individual's physical remains.
