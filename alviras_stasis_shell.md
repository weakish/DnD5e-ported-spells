_6th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M  
**Duration:** 10 days

The largest object that can be affected by this spell is a large standard spellbook, and the smallest object is the size of a potion vial. An object protected by this spell  cannot be affected by any force less powerful than a [Disintegrate] spell, though the stasis shell itself can be dispelled. The protected object is surrounded by a faint blue glow. The object has its normal weight and can be moved normally, though it cannot be physically touched or accessed; for example, a protected book could not be opened. The spell cannot affect living tissue directly, though living tissue in a container can be warded. For all intents, time has stopped for the object in the field.
