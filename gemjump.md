# Gemjump
_7th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute   
**Range:** Self   
**Components:** V, S, M (a rogue stone worth 5000 gp.)    
**Duration:** Special

This spell is initially cast upon a special gem known as a rogue stone. At any time after the initial casting, you can immediately teleport to the location of the gem by uttering a command
word on your turn (no action required). Only you and your normal clothing will be teleported; any chains, equipment, or allies will be left behind.If the area the gem is in is too confined, you will appear in the nearest sufficiently large space.  
Gemjumping requires only the uttering of a word, whether you are in chains or otherwise bound, within a magical entrapment such as a force cage, resurrected, shapechanged, becoming undead, or on a different plane or planet than the stone. However, you cannot use the command word if feebleminded, asleep, unconscious, charmed, petrified, paralyzed, or insane, nor will the gemjump operate if you or the rogue stone is within an [Antimagic Field].  
The rogue stone itself radiates no detectable magical energy unless it is in the process of
gemjumping. Multiple gemjumps can be cast on a single rogue stone by separate wizards. These additional spells do not negate the previous gemjumps on the rogue stone. Only a [Wish] spell will dispel those magics on a rogue stone. Physical destruction of the rogue stone will also destroy the magic, though spellcasters who have links with a rogue stone will be aware of its destruction.
