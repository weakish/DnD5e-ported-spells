# Bone Blight
_5th-level Necromancy_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 30 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of aqua regia)    
**Duration:** Special 

This evil, deadly curse slowly erodes the healthy bones of any chosen creature within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails the saving throw, all bones in the creature slowly begin to dissolve, eventually reducing it to a quivering mound of formless flesh.  
Except for experiencing a strange "tingling sensation" at the time of casting, the victim is not immediately aware of the spell's effect (making it even more insidious).  
In the short term (from the moment of casting to the first full day), the bones of the victim become brittle, greatly increasing susceptibility to falling damage. The victim has disadvantage with damage rolls from falling; by the end of the first day, current hit points are reduced by 20%.  
In the mid-term (lasting 1d6+1 days from the time of the casting), the victim is subject to frequent painful fractures. The victim has disadvantage with damage rolls from piercing, slashing, bludgeoning or falling damage. By the end of this period, the victim's hit points
are reduced by 60%.  
In the terminal stage, the victim's bones finally dissolve, collapsing the spine and skull, bringing a slow and painful death.  
This spell prevents natural healing. Magical healing slows, but cannot stop, the terminal stage. Every 10 points of magical healing prolongs the intermediate stage for one full day, to the maximum limit of one day per point of Constitution. The slow dissolution of bone can be halted only by a [Remove Curse], a [Cure Disease] followed by a successful [Dispel Magic], a [Heal] followed by a [Restoration] spell. Once the spell has been broken, lost hit points can be healed normally or by magical means.  
Casting this spell is an evil act and will have alignment repercussions.  
The spell has no effect on undead and construct.
